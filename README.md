## 🚀 Overview

Our event booking platform ensures **fair and transparent ticket distribution** using a **priority queue system** powered by **Spotify listening history** and **Hive blockchain integration**. This eliminates scalpers and ensures that true fans get access to tickets first.

## 🔑 How It Works

1. **Login with Hive Keychain** and select an event.
2. **User Ranking & Priority:** Ranked based on your genuine engagement with an artist (percentage of their songs in your top 100 Spotify tracks).
3. **Live Queue Updates:** Users receive **real-time rank updates** via WebSockets.
4. **Rank #1?** You get **1 minute** to complete payment.
5. **Secure Ticketing:** Payment is broadcasted on the **Hive blockchain** to ensure **security and transparency**.
6. **Access Anytime:** Successfully booked tickets are stored securely on the blockchain.
